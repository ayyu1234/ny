      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the STAR ENGINEERING website or placing an order through any official channel, you agree to be bound by our Terms & Conditions, policies, and operational procedures as listed herein. Your continued use of our services constitutes your agreement and compliance. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please refrain from using our platform or initiating transactions. These terms ensure a transparent, secure, and efficient service experience for both parties in all dealings and communications.

    <div data-aos="fade-up">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">2. Product Information</h3>
      <p>
        All products offered by STAR ENGINEERING are subject to stock availability. We strive to keep our product catalog accurate and up-to-date; however, we reserve the right to modify, discontinue, or replace products without prior notification. Product specifications, images, and pricing provided are for general reference and may vary slightly. Customers are encouraged to confirm product details with our sales team before placing an order to ensure clarity and satisfaction regarding the materials being procured.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div data-aos="fade-up">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">3. Order Placement</h3>
      <p>
        Orders should be placed only through STAR ENGINEERING’s official website or directly via our authorized representatives. We are not liable for any order or transaction made through third-party agents, resellers, or unauthorized personnel. Customers must confirm all specifications, quantities, and pricing at the time of order. Any communication not confirmed by our team shall not be considered valid. This policy ensures safe and reliable order management, reducing errors and miscommunication throughout the process.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div data-aos="fade-up">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">4. Billing Policy</h3>
      <p>
        All billing will be based strictly on the actual weight of the material at the time of dispatch from our warehouse. Estimated weight shown during order placement is for general guidance only and not considered final for billing purposes. This approach guarantees fair pricing based on the exact quantity delivered. Final invoice, including weight slips (if applicable), will be provided during or after dispatch. No disputes will be entertained once the final invoice is issued and acknowledged by the client.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div data-aos="fade-up">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">5. Payment Terms</h3>
      <p>
        100% payment must be made upfront at the time of placing the order, unless otherwise approved by STAR ENGINEERING management in writing. We do not offer credit, delayed, or installment-based payments under standard terms. Payments can be made via NEFT, RTGS, UPI, cheque (subject to clearance), or any other approved mode. Orders will only be processed upon successful receipt of full payment. Non-payment or delays may lead to order cancellation without liability on our part.


      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div data-aos="fade-up">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">6. Refund & Adjustment</h3>
      <p>
        If there is any discrepancy in the weight of material dispatched versus estimated weight, a refund or adjustment (as applicable) will be processed within 3 to 5 working days of dispatch. All claims will be verified through internal documentation, weighbridge slips, and billing records. Customers must report issues within 48 hours of delivery. Refunds will be credited through the original payment method or adjusted in future transactions, as mutually agreed upon.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div data-aos="fade-up">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">7. Delivery & Logistics</h3>
      <p>
        While we prioritize timely and safe delivery of materials, STAR ENGINEERING shall not be held responsible for delays caused by third-party logistics, natural disasters, traffic disruptions, strikes, or any unforeseen circumstances. Delivery timelines shared are estimates and not guaranteed. Customers are advised to plan accordingly. We coordinate closely with our logistics partners to ensure smooth transit and may provide tracking or dispatch confirmation where applicable for transparency.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div data-aos="fade-up">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">8. Cancellation Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Orders confirmed by payment or written agreement cannot be canceled under normal circumstances. However, in exceptional cases such as changes in availability or customer error, cancellation requests may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Applicable cancellation fees or deductions will be informed prior to processing. STAR ENGINEERING holds the final authority to approve or deny cancellation requests. This ensures fair handling for both inventory and customer commitments.

    </div>
  
    <div data-aos="fade-up">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">9. Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>
        All products are sold “as-is” unless specifically covered by a manufacturer’s warranty or a written quality assurance document issued by STAR ENGINEERING. We do not provide warranties of any kind—express or implied—regarding the durability, suitability, or performance of the products once delivered. We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from product usage, mishandling, or improper storage after delivery.
